## About

Go Cycling is a cycling tracker app built exclusively for iOS with SwiftUI. It is intended to be extremely easy to use for cyclists of all levels.

A key part of Go Cycling is it's privacy stance, there is no requirement for a sign in of any kind and all data is solely stored on the user's device. It also does not contain any advertisements.

Go Cycling makes use of many of Apple's frameworks and API's including:
* Core Location for location data
* MapKit for embedded maps throughout the app
* Core Data for persistent data storage of cycling routes and user preferences
* Combine for location update event processing

## System Requirements

This app is designed to support all iPhones and iPads with iOS14/iPadOS14 and above due to the use of the latest SwiftUI features.

For iPads, this includes support for both landscape and portait modes along with Slide Over and multitasking screen sizes.

## Usage

Note: For Go Cycling to track your current location, you must allow location access in Settings (the app will also ask for permission on the first launch). The location permissions must be set to "Always Allow" for location updates to occur while the app is not on the screen.

To use this app, first, start a new cycling route from the Cycle tab. The timer should start incrementing, you can choose to leave your device locked or unlocked.

While the route is ongoing you will see metrics on the Cycle tab of your current progress as well as your path on the map.

Once you are finished with your cycling route, you can compelete the route by using the stop button. The route will be saved to your device and is viewable in the History tab along with metrics about the route.

More routes can be created in this same way and they can all be viewed, sorted and deleted from the History tab.

## App Features

Go Cycling has many features packed into three tabs; Cycle, History and Settings.

## Future Development

This app has been an immense amount of fun to develop and I have greatly enjoyed using SwiftUI! I am planning on continuing to add features as time permits and some ideas that are on my roadmap are listed below:

Thank you very much for viewing this project!
